# A better solution to the 100 prisoners riddle
# By: Richard Vall√©e
# Date: 7 July 2022
#
# It involves a simple change in strategy that improves odds from 31% to 33% in a 100 sample size and up to 52% in a 10 sample size.
#
# The strategy:
#   When they don't find their number, prisoners report the number on the card found in the last box/drawer
#   When the sequence is 51, and only when it's 51, it will always be the right answer.
#   This means any sequence 51 and shorter will work, not 50
#
# This also creates an alternative version of the puzzle:
#   How to get better than 50% odds from opening half of 10 boxes
